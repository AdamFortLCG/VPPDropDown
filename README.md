VPPDropDown is an iOS library that allows you to create dropdown-like menus
in a table view, as seen in old Twitter 3 for iPhone. 

You can create three kinds of dropdown menus:
 
- Disclosure, childs of drop down cell are treated as disclosure cells, 
useful for grouping detailed view controllers.
- Selection, childs of drop down cell are treated as selection cells, 
useful for editing preferences.
- Custom, childs of drop down cell should be decorated by the delegate.
 
This project contains a sample application using it. Just open the project in 
XCode, build it and run it.
